# Getting started with mbed Client on mbed OS

This is the mbed Client example for mbed OS (we also have one for [Linux](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-client-linux-example)). It demonstrates how to register a device with mbed Device Connector, how to read and write values, and how to deregister. If you are unfamiliar with mbed Device Connector, we recommend that you read [the introduction to the data model](https://docs.mbed.com/docs/mbed-device-connector-web-interfaces/en/latest/#the-mbed-device-connector-data-model) first.

The application:

* Connects to network with either WiFi, Ethernet, 6LoWPAN ND or Thread connection.
* Registers with mbed Device Connector.
* Gives mbed Device Connector access to its resources (read and write).
* Records the number of clicks on the device’s button and sends the number to mbed Device Connector.
* Lets you control the blink pattern of the LED on the device (through mbed Device Connector).

## Required hardware

* [FRDM-K64F](http://developer.mbed.org/platforms/frdm-k64f/) board.
* 1-2 micro-USB cables.
* [mbed 6LoWPAN gateway router](https://firefly-iot.com/product/firefly-6lowpan-gateway-2-4ghz/) for 6LoWPAN ND and Thread.
* mbed 6LoWPAN shield (AT86RF212B/[AT86RF233](https://firefly-iot.com/product/firefly-arduino-shield-2-4ghz/)) for 6LoWPAN ND and Thread.
* Ethernet cable and connection to the internet.

## Required software

* [ARM mbed account](https://developer.mbed.org/account/login/?next=/).
* [mbed-cli](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-cli) - to build the example programs. To learn how to build mbed OS applications with mbed-cli, see [the user guide](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-cli/blob/master/README.md).
* [Serial port monitor](https://developer.mbed.org/handbook/SerialPC#host-interface-and-terminal-applications).

## Application setup

To configure the example application, please:

1. [Choose connection type](#connection-type).
1. [Set client credentials](#client-credentials).
1. [Set 6LoWPAN ND & Thread settings](#6lowpan-nd-&-thread-settings).
1. [Set Ethernet settings](#ethernet-settings)
1. [Set cellular settings](#cellular-settings)
1. [Set Wi-Fi settings](#wi-fi-settings)
1. [Set up an IP address](#ip-address-setup). This step is optional.
1. [Set a socket type](#setting-socket-type). This step is optional.

### Connection type

By default the application uses Ethernet as the default connection type. The connection type can be changed in the beginning of the main.cpp file by setting one of the five connection types as defined and all the rest as undefined. For example to enable 6LoWPAN ND mode:

```
#undef ETHERNET
#undef WIFI
#undef CELLULAR
#define MESH_LOWPAN_ND
#undef MESH_THREAD
```

### Client credentials

The client side certificate needs to be created and set in order for the application to register to the Connector service.

1. Go to [mbed Device Connector](https://connector.mbed.com) and log in with your mbed account.
1. On mbed Device Connector, go to [My Devices > Security credentials](https://connector.mbed.com/#credentials) and click the **Get my device security credentials** button to get new credentials for your device.
1. Replace the contents in `security.h` of this project's directory with content copied above.

### 6LoWPAN ND & Thread settings

#### mbed Gateway

To use the example application in 6LoWPAN ND or Thread mode, you first need set up an mbed 6LoWPAN gateway router. Clone the [mbed-client-example-6lowpan](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-client-example-6lowpan) repository and follow the [gateway configuration](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-client-example-6lowpan#gateway-configuration) instructions.

#### Channel settings

In both 6LoWPAN ND and Thread mode you need to set the channel settings to match the mbed Gateway settings. Channel settings can be found in the `MACROS.txt` file. For 2.4GHz shields (AT86RF233) use the following values:

```
YOTTA_CFG_MBED_MESH_API_6LOWPAN_ND_CHANNEL_PAGE=0
YOTTA_CFG_MBED_MESH_API_6LOWPAN_ND_CHANNEL=12
YOTTA_CFG_MBED_MESH_API_THREAD_CONFIG_CHANNEL_PAGE=0
YOTTA_CFG_MBED_MESH_API_THREAD_CONFIG_CHANNEL=12
```

Values for sub GHz shields (AT86RF212B):

```
YOTTA_CFG_MBED_MESH_API_6LOWPAN_ND_CHANNEL_PAGE=2
YOTTA_CFG_MBED_MESH_API_6LOWPAN_ND_CHANNEL=1
YOTTA_CFG_MBED_MESH_API_THREAD_CONFIG_CHANNEL_PAGE=2
YOTTA_CFG_MBED_MESH_API_THREAD_CONFIG_CHANNEL=1
```

For more information about the radio shields, please see the [mbed-client-example-6lowpan](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-client-example-6lowpan#radio-module-identification) documentation.

#### 6LoWPAN specific settings

TBD

#### Thread specific settings

TBD


### Ethernet settings

TBD

### Cellular settings

TBD

### Wi-Fi settings

TBD


### IP address setup (optional)

This example uses IPv4 to communicate with the [mbed Device Connector Server](https://api.connector.mbed.com). The example program should automatically get an IPv4 address from the router when connected over Ethernet.

If your network does not have DHCP enabled, you have to manually assign a static IP address to the board. We recommend having DHCP enabled to make everything run smoothly.

### Changing socket type (binding mode - optional)

Your device can connect to mbed Device Connector via one of two binding modes: UDP or TCP. The default is UDP.

To change the binding mode:

1. In the `simpleclient.h` file, find the parameter `SOCKET_MODE`.
1. The default is `M2MInterface::UDP`.
1. To switch to TCP, change it to `M2MInterface::TCP`.

Then re-build and flash the application.

<span class="tips">**Tip:** The instructions in this document remain the same, irrespective of the socket mode you select.</span>

## Building the example

To build the example application:

1. Clone [this](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-client-quickstart-morpheus) repository.
1. Open a command line tool and navigate to the project’s directory.
1. Update mbed-os sources using the `mbed update` command.
1. [Configure](#application-setup) the client application.
1. Build the application by selecting the hardware board and build toolchain using the command `mbed compile -m K64F -t GCC_ARM -c -j0`. mbed-cli builds a binary file under the project’s `.build` directory.
1. Plug the Ethernet cable into the board.
1. Plug the micro-USB cable into the **OpenSDA** port. The board is listed as a mass-storage device.
1. Drag the binary `.build/K64F/GCC_ARM/mbed-client-quickstart-morpheus.bin` to the board to flash the application.
1. The board is automatically programmed with the new binary. A flashing LED on it indicates that it is still working. When the LED stops blinking, the board is ready to work.
1. Press the **RESET** button on the board to run the program.
1. For verification, continue to the [Monitoring the application](#monitoring-the-application) chapter.


## Monitoring the application

The application prints debug messages over the serial port, so you can monitor its activity with a serial port monitor. The application uses baud rate 115200.

<span class="notes">**Note:** Instructions to set this up are located [here](https://developer.mbed.org/handbook/SerialPC#host-interface-and-terminal-applications).</span>

After connecting, you should see messages about connecting to mbed Device Connector:

```
In app_start()
IP address 10.2.15.222
Device name 6868df22-d353-4150-b90a-a878130859d9
```

<span class="notes">**Note:** Device name is the endpoint name you will need later on when [testing the application](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-client-quickstart-morpheus#testing-the-application) chapter.</span>

When you click the `SW2` button on your board you should see messages about the value changes:

```
handle_button_click, new value of counter is 1
```

## Testing the application

1. Flash the application.
1. Verify that the registration succeeded. You should see `Registered object successfully!` printed to the serial port.
1. On mbed Device Connector, go to [My devices > Connected devices](https://connector.mbed.com/#endpoints). Your device should be listed here.
1. Press the `SW2` button on the device a number of times (make a note of how many times you did that).
1. Go to [Device Connector > API Console](https://connector.mbed.com/#console).
1. Enter `https://api.connector.mbed.com/endpoints/DEVICE_NAME/3200/0/5501` in the URI field and click **TEST API**. Replace `DEVICE_NAME` with your actual endpoint name. The device name can be found in the `source/security.h` file, see variable `MBED_ENDPOINT_NAME` or it can be found from the traces [Monitoring the application](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-client-quickstart-morpheus#monitoring-the-application).
1. The number of times you pressed `SW2` is shown.
1. Press the `SW3` button to unregister from mbed Device Connector. You should see `Unregistered Object Successfully` printed to the serial port and the LED starts blinking. This will also stop your application. Press the `RESET` button to run the program again.

<span class="tips">**Tip:** If you get an error, for example `Server Response: 410 (Gone)`, clear your browser's cache, log out, and log back in.</span>

<span class="notes">**Note:** Only GET methods can be executed through [Device Connector > API Console](https://connector.mbed.com/#console). For other methods check the [mbed Device Connector Quick Start](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-connector-api-node-quickstart).

### Application resources

The application exposes three [resources](https://docs.mbed.com/docs/mbed-device-connector-web-interfaces/en/latest/#the-mbed-device-connector-data-model):

1. `3200/0/5501`. Number of presses of SW2 (GET).
2. `3201/0/5850`. Blink function, blinks `LED1` when executed (POST).
3. `3201/0/5853`. Blink pattern, used by the blink function to determine how to blink. In the format of `1000:500:1000:500:1000:500` (PUT).

For information on how to get notifications when resource 1 changes, or how to use resources 2 and 3, take a look at the [mbed Device Connector Quick Start](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-connector-api-node-quickstart).
